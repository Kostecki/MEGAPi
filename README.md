# MEGAPi
Assorted documentation for setting up a Raspberry Pi Zero W as a WiFi hotspot with 3G connectivity for our MEGABoominator project.

The project is using a Raspberry Pi Zero W (but other flavors of Pi should work) running Raspbian Stretch Lite (Version November 2017 as of March 2nd 2018). The repository contains a "*modified*" version of the Raspbian image for easily getting the project up and running as we need it.   

**These changes are:**

* Locale changed to `en_DK`
* Keyboard layout set to `danish`
* SSH enabled (with my public key added ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ)
* Wi-Fi Country set to `Denmark`
* Hostname set to `MEGAPi`
* Filesystem expanded
